# TCR-MPcell
- We deposited the codes for the TCR-related analyses in the MP cell project in this repository (Kawajiri et al.).
- The TCR analyses were conducted by Kazuyoshi Ishigaki (Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Keio University School of Medicine/Laboratory for Human Immunogenetics, RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences)
- The fundamental strategy to extract TCR-CDR3 phenotypes is explained in our GitHub page (https://github.com/immunogenomics/cdr3-QTL). Specifically, we utilized the "CDR3 phenotype 4 (middle positions)" strategy explained in https://github.com/immunogenomics/cdr3-QTL/blob/main/vignettes/cdr3_phenotype_demo_v1.ipynb
- You can install all packages from the CRAN website (https://cran.r-project.org/). The estimaetd install time is within one hour on a standard computer. The expected run time of the following codes is within a few minutes on a standard desktop computer.
